Suddenly, she sees someone running to the trees.

'Look!' she says. 'Who's that?'

'It's The Cat!' says Nathan. 'Remember him from the newspaper? He's going to that car!'

'Quick!' says Natalie. 'Let's get my car!'

'Do you want me to drive?' Nathan asks. 'I can drive really fast.'

'No!' Natalie tells him. 'I'm driving!'

Natalie drives fast and it is a dangerous road.

'Be careful, Miss Nevons,' says Nathan. 'You have a movie to finish, remember!'

'It's OK, I'm a good driver,' she says. She smiles. 'And you can call me Natalie.'

Nathan smiles, too. 'OK,' he says.

'We're getting near to him!' says Natalie.

'Yes, but look! There's a train coming!' says Nathan.

Natalie looks quickly. 'It's OK!' she says. 'It's not going to hit us.'

The train is moving fast.

'We aren't going to do it!' says Nathan.

'Yes, we are!' Natalie tells him.

'Wow! That was close!' says Nathan.

Natalie laughs, and says nothing.

Suddenly, two policemen see Natalie's car.

'Look at them!' says one policeman. 'How fast are they going, Joe?'

'Too fast, Sam,' says Joe. 'Let's stop them.'

'It's not going to be easy,' says Sam, 'but let's go!'

Suddenly, Nathan sees the police car.

'Er, Natalie,' he says.

'What is it?' she asks.

'There's a police car behind us,' says Nathan. 'It wants us to stop.'

'I'm not stopping,' she says. 'It's OK, we can tell them everything later. First we have to stop The Cat.'

Suddenly, The Cat sees the police car, too.

'Oh, no!' he says. 'I need to get out of this car.'

He stops his car and runs.

Soon after, Natalie and Nathan are jumping from Natalie's car. The Cat looks back and sees them. 'They're stopping, too,' he thinks. 'So, who can run the fastest?'

Minutes later, the police car stops near Natalie's car. The two policemen jump out, and look for Natalie and Nathan.

'Where are they, Sam?' asks Joe.

'I don't know,' says Sam. 'I can't see them. There are too many people.'

'There he is!' says Natalie. 'There's The Cat!'

'He's running to that building,' says Nathan.

'Let's go!' says Natalie, and she runs after The Cat.

Nathan runs after her. 'He's going up to the roof!' he says.

And the three of them begin to climb up to the roof of the building.

Suddenly, The Cat throws his bag at Natalie. She does not see it, but Nathan does.

'Natalie, the bag!' he calls.

The bag does not hit Natalie, but it hits Nathan.

'Nathan, are you all right?' calls Natalie.

'I'm OK,' says Nathan.

The Cat and Natalie run across the roof of the building. Then, The Cat jumps from one building to the next.

Natalie watches him. 'Can I do that?' she thinks.

Natalie jumps.

Nathan sees her. 'Wow! Look at her!' he thinks.

The Cat sees her, too. 'How can I get away from her?' he thinks.

He cannot get away from her.

'Got you!' says Natalie, and she jumps on him. 'So who are you?'

She takes off The Cat's mask. 'You!' she says.

'It's Bud!' says Nathan.

The policemen arrive and look from Natalie to Bud and back again.

'It's the movie star, Natalie Nevons!' says Joe.

'Yes!' says Sam. 'And The Cat!'

The next day, Nathan and Natalie tell Zak their story. 'Bud is The Cat?' he asks.

'That's right,' says Natalie.

'And you want to be Brad's new stand-in?' Zak says to Nathan. 'OK, but we need a new stand-in for Natalie. Who can do her stunts?'

'Natalie doesn't need a stand-in!' says Nathan, laughing. 'She can do her stunts!'
